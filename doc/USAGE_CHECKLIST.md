      needed.

      Below you see the parts that you should check/update;
  * [ ] Common properties; `name`, `description`, `keywords`, `homapage`,
        `version`, `license`, `authors`, `support.issues` and
        `extra.projectTitle`
* [ ] Application configuration / setup
  * [ ] [.env](../.env) Change `APP_SECRET` value with new one, you can use
        eg. [this](http://nux.net/secret) tool for that. Also remember to
        change that `APP_SECRET` value in [.env.test](../.env.test) and in
        [.env.gh-actions](../.env.gh-actions) files.
  * [ ] [application.json](../secrets/application.json) Change file contents
        to match your application configuration - specially you need to
        generate new `JWT_PASSPHRASE` value. Also remember to do those
        changes to [application_test.json](../secrets/application_test.json)
        files.
  * [ ] [site.webmanifest](../public/site.webmanifest) - check that file
        contents - [information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)
        - and made necessary changes.

        [information](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro)
        - and made necessary changes.
  * [ ] [favicon.ico](../public/favicon.ico) - change your application favicon
        to match your brand.
  * [ ] [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) Change `container_name` to
        match your application.
  * [ ] [mysql_custom.cnf](../docker/mysql/mysql_custom.cnf) Check that MySQL
        has custom configuration that your application needs. Also check that
        [Dockerfile](../docker/mysql/Dockerfile) is matching your production
        setup.
  * [ ] [nginx.conf](../docker/nginx/nginx.conf) Check that Nginx has proper
        configuration for your application needs. Also check that
        [Dockerfile](../docker/mysql/Dockerfile) is matching your production
        setup.
  * [ ] [php.ini](../docker/php/php.ini) Check that PHP has proper production
        configuration. Also check [php-dev.ini](../docker/php/php-dev.ini) for
        development environment setup.
* [ ] 3rd party services that you might not need _or_ you need to change those
      to work with _your_ application - if you don't need to use those services
      just delete those files and all is done.
